# livetext

### take a bullet to the face for livetext-
##### and if you do and you are still able to operate your device, tell your best friends about it

livetext will be a website running on a ESP8266 with a live webcam aimed at a display.
Underneath said webcam display there will be a text bax, what ever you type and leave 
in the bax while you click on the send button will be visible on the display. Yay!!
